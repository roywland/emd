<span class="headlinesr">CPR - INFANT</span><BR>

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Does anyone there know CPR? (Trained bystanders may still need instructions)

<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Is there an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) available?
<br><br>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">YES: Send someone to get it and let me know when it arrives at the patient's side.<br>
(Continue to Step 3. When the AED arrives, turn to <a href="aed.html">AED Reference card</a>.)
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">NO: (Continue .. .)</ul><br>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Get the phone next to the patient or use the speakerphone.
<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Listen carefully. I'll tell you what to do.

<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Lay the baby flat on his/her back on a table or the floor. Position yourself by the baby's side.

<img src = "100bpm.gif" align = right>
<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Put the index and middle fingertips on the center of the baby's chest, right between the nipples.
<br>Push down about 1 &frac12; inches, allowing the chest to return to its normal position between each
pump. Try to pump twice every second, at least 100 compressions per minute.

<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">UNTRAINED: Do compressions until help takes over or the patient begins to breathe, move or
cough. I'll stay on the line.<BR><BR>
TRAINED AND WILLING TO DO VENTILATIONS: After 30 compressions, pinch the nose and
lift the chin slightly, making sure the neck remains level. Give 2 small breaths and pump the
chest 30 more times. Keep doing 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help takes over or the
patient begins to breathe, move or cough. I'll stay on the line.
<BR><BR>
(NOTE: If the patient begins to breathe, move or cough. Go to the <a href="airway.html">Airway Control card.</a>)
<BR><BR>
(Regardless if the caller is untrained or trained, if the caller reports the high likelihood of
asphyxia, such as drowning or suffocation, follow instructions for TRAINED.)
<BR><BR>
(REMEMBER: If this is an obstructed airway, instruct the callers to look for a foreign body in the
throat before they start each set of rescue breaths. If they see a foreign body, remove it).
<BR><BR>
(NOTE: IF THE CALLER REPORTS VOMIT INSTRUCT THE CALLER to turn the patient's head to
the side. Sweep it all out with your fingers before rescue breaths.)
