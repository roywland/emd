<span class="headlinesr">CPR - CHILD 1-8 yrs.</span><BR>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone there know CPR? (Trained bystanders may still need instructions)

<br><br><li>Is there an AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) available?
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>YES: Send someone to get it and let me know when it arrives at the patient's side.<br>
(Continue to Step 3. When the AED arrives, turn to <a href="aed.html">AED Reference card</a>.)
<li>NO: (Continue .. .)</ul><br>
<li>Get the phone next to the patient or use the speakerphone.
<br><br><li>Listen carefully. I'll tell you what to do.
<br><br><li>Get the patient <b>flat</b> on their back on the <b>floor</b> or a hard surface. Kneel by the patient's side.

<br><br><li>Put the heel of your hand on the center of their chest, right between the nipples. Put your other hand
on top of that hand. Push down hard and fast at least two inches in depth, allowing the chest to
return to its normal position between each pump. Try to pump twice every second,
at least 100 compressions per minute.
<br><br>
<li><b>UNTRAINED:</b> Do compressions until help takes over or the patient begins to breathe, move or
cough. I'll stay on the line.<br><br>
<b>TRAINED AND WILLING TO DO VENTILATIONS:</b> After 30 compressions, pinch the nose
and lift the chin so that the head bends back. Give 2 QUICK breaths and pump the chest 30
more times. Keep doing 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help takes over or the patient
begins to breathe, move or cough. I'll stay on the line.</ol><br>
<b>(NOTE: If the patient begins to breathe, move or cough. Go to the <a href="airway.html">Airway Control card</a>.)
<br><br>(Regardless if the caller is untrained or trained, if the caller reports the high likelihood of
asphyxia, such as drowning or suffocation, follow the instructions for TRAINED.)
<br><br>(REMEMBER:</b> If this is an obstructed airway, instruct the callers to look for a foreign body in the
throat before they start each set of rescue breaths. If they see a foreign body, remove it.)<br><br>
<b>(NOTE: IF THE CALLER REPORTS VOMIT INSTRUCT THE CALLER</b> to turn the patient's head
to the side. Sweep it all out with your fingers before rescue breaths.)<hr>
