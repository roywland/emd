<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Position the AED close to the patient's left ear, on a dry, non-metallic surface free of any hazardous
materials. The patient must be on his/her back.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Turn on the AED. Depending on the model you may have to press a power button or lift the monitor
cover or screen to the "UP" position.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">If you see any medication patches (nitroglycerine or nicotine), remove them and wipe the area dry.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Does the patient have a pacemaker? Pacemakers are usually found on the upper-chest under the
skin and look like a small lump slightly smaller than a deck of playing cards.<br><br>
<ul><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">a. YES: Pads must be placed 3 - 5 inches from the pacemaker
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">b. NO: (Continue with Step 5)</ul><br>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Attach the Pads - If the pads are not already plugged into the machine, plug them in now.
<br>Quickly open and attach the self-adhesive pads directly to the skin of the patient. The pads may be
marked showing proper placement. One pad should be placed on the upper right side of chest
directly below the collar bone. The other pad should be placed on the left chest with the top of the
pad a few inches below the arm pit.
<br>
<b>Patient's under the age of 8:</b> Use pediatric pads, if available. If not available, use adult pads.
Place one pad in the center of the child's chest and the other pad in the center of the child's back.
<br>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Analyze the Rhythm - Clear everyone away from the patient and ensure that no one is touching
the patient. Some AED's require the operator to press an "ANALYZE" button while others
automatically begin analysis when the pads are attached to the chest.<br>
<br>If a shockable rhythm is present, the device will announce it through a displayed message, visual
or auditory alarm, or synthesized voice statement that a shock is indicated. If the AED does not
recommend a shock and the patient does not have signs of circulation, CPR must be continued
until help arrives.<br><center>

<br><br>
<b>SHOCK ADVISED:</b> - Again, clear the patient ensuring that no one is touching the patient and
press the shock button. Follow the prompts of the AED.
<br><br>
<b>NO SHOCK ADVISED:</b> Check for signs of circulation (moving, coughing, normal breathing, or
pulse). If there is no sign of circulation, continue CPR.<br><center>

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Once the AED is turned on and patient analysis is started do not turn the
AED off.<hr>
