<b>LABOR: Imminent or Active Delivery:</b><br>
(contractions less than 2 mins apart, strong desire to push, crowning, etc.)
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Listen carefully and I'll tell you what to do. If possible, get the phone next to the patient.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Have the patient lay flat on her back on a bed or the floor. Don't let her use the toilet. Have her
relax by taking slow, deep breaths through her mouth.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Ask her to remove her clothing below the waist and bend her knees. Place a clean towel
under her buttocks and have additional towels ready if available.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The baby's head usually delivers first. As the head begins to deliver, support it gently to
prevent the baby from coming out too fast. Do not push or pull on the baby.<br><br>
<u>If the caller reports leg, arm, buttocks, or umbilical cord presentation -
<a href="#comp">GO TO COMPLICATIONS</a></u><br>
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Be sure the umbilical cord is not wrapped around the baby's neck; if it is, try to slip the cord
gently over the baby's head using your fingers.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Once the head is out, the rest of the body will usually be delivered with the next few
contractions. There will be water and blood with the delivery - this is normal. Support the
baby as it is delivered.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Once the baby is delivered, clean out its mouth and nose with a clean dry cloth and wrap it
up in a clean dry blanket or towel. Do not cut or pull on the cord.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">If the baby is not breathing or crying on its own, rub its back or gently slap the bottoms of
the baby's feet. <br>If NO Response, go to <a href="cpri.html">INFANT CPR</a>.
<br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Keep the baby warm and place it between the mother's legs, being sure to keep the baby
below the level of the mother. The contractions may start up again when the placenta is
delivered - this is normal. Keep the baby at the same level as the placenta.</ol>
<b><a name="comp">COMPLICATIONS:</a></b> (leg, arm, buttocks, or umbilical presentation)<br>
Reassure the mother. Ask her to get up onto her hands and knees. Have her try to relax by
taking slow, deep breaths through her mouth. Tell her not to push.<br><br>
<b>LABOR:</b> Non Imminent Delivery<br>
Have her lie in a comfortable position on her left side. Have her relax by taking slow, deep
breaths through her mouth.<hr><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
