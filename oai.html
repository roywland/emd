<span class="headlinesr">OBSTRUCTED AIRWAY - INFANT</span><BR><BR>

If the patient is conscious: Follow Step 1.<br><br>
If the patient is unconscious, go to <a href="cpri.html">CPR INFANT</a> and instruct the caller to look for a foreign body in
the throat. If they see a foreign body, remove it.<br>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">There might be something blocking the baby's airway. Bring the baby to the phone.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Is the baby able to cry or cough?<br>
<ul><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">YES: Stop.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">NO: Listen carefully and I will tell you what to do next.<br><br>
Remove the clothing from the baby's chest. Pick up the baby. Turn the baby face down so it lies along your forearm. Rest
your forearm on your thigh and support the baby's jaw in your hand.<br>
Let me repeat that: Remove the clothing from the baby's chest. Pick up the baby. Turn the baby
face down so it lies along your forearm. Rest your forearm on your thigh and support the
baby's jaw in your hand. Do that, and come back to the phone. If I am not here, stay on the line.</ul><br>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Listen carefully. Tilt the baby with the head down slightly. Use the heel of your other hand to
strike the back 5 times, right between the shoulder blades. Do that and then come back to the
phone.<br><br>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
Listen carefully. Lay the baby flat on its back on a table or the floor. Put your index and
middle fingers directly between the nipples. Push down &frac12; to 1 inch. Push down 5 times
rapidly. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Do that and come back to the phone.<br><br><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
Is the baby breathing normally?</li>
<ul><li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">YES: Roll the baby on its side and check for breathing until help takes over.
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">NO: (Repeat steps 3-4 until the item is expelled or the infant becomes unconscious.)</li></ol>

If the infant becomes unconscious, go to <a href="cpri.html">CPR INFANT</a> and instruct the caller to look for a foreign
body in the throat. If they see a foreign body, remove it.<hr>
